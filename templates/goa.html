											<p>Palolem Beach is a stretch of white sand on a bay in Goa, South India. It's known for its calm waters and for its nightlife, including "silent discos" where partygoers wear headphones. Lined with palm trees and colorful wooden shacks, the beach faces Canacona Island, known for its resident monkeys. To the south, turtles nest at Galgibaga Beach. Inland, Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is home to birds, wild boars and gaur.Palolem Beach is largely unspoiled and is inhabited by both local fishermen and by foreign tourists who live in shacks along the shore or in the main village itself.[1] It is about one mile (approximately 1.61 km) long and is crescent-shaped; one can view the entire beach from either end. Both ends of the beach consist of rocks jutting out into the sea. The depth of the sea increases gradually, being shallowest at the northern end of the beach, making it safe for average swimmers, and the currents are not fast.

										<p class="offers_text">The Bom Jesus Basilica, perhaps Goa's most famous church and among the most revered by Christians worldwide, is partially in ruins but still a model of simplicity and elegance, and a fine example of Jesuit architecture.alt

This is the only church in Old Goa, which is not plastered on the outside, the lime plaster having been stripped off by a zealous Portuguese conservationist in 1950.

Located at Old Goa, 10 kilometres east of Panaji, the Bom Jesus Basilica is a World Heritage Monument.

The foundation stone of this remarkably large church was laid on 24 November 1594 and the church was consecrated by Fr. Alexia de Menezes, the Archbishop of Goa and Primate of India consecrated it when it was completed on 15 May 1605. In 1946 it was raised to the status of a minor Basilica.

The Order of Jesuits was suppressed in 1759 and its property confiscated by the Portuguese State. The church was, however allowed to continue services.

										<p class="offers_text">Baga beach is one of Goa’s most popular beaches. It is between the Baga River in the north and Calangute beach in the south. The Baga-Calangute-Candolim stretch is one of the longest sandy shores in Goa, and attracts thousands of tourists in peak season. Baga is 17.3 kilometers from Panaji, the state capital via the NH 66 and Chogm Road. There are plenty of beach shacks, coffee bars, clubs, shops, street food vendors, and water sports activities to choose from. The beach is popular for its nightlife too.Tourism first arrived in Goa in the late 1960s. The flower-children or hippies came to Goa from San Francisco after the famous gathering in 1967, which was referred to as the “Summer of Love”. Goa, at that time, had just become a part of India. Very few people knew of Goa. There were hardly any tourists.</p>
